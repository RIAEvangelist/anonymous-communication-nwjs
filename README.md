Anonymous Communication App
=======================
***Government level encryption/decryption (U.S. FIPS). The same encryption is used by NSA and other governments around the world to secure classified data.***

####Instant Messaging

To maintain the most secure and anonymous communication, both you and the person you are 
IMing must know eachothers handles, and must use the same cipher. 
*Both handles and ciphers are case sensitive!*
All communications are automatically encrypted and decrypted for you using the cipher.

Handles are encrypted using the cipher so anyone can use any handle, given your cipher is unique, even if someone else chooses to use the same handle you will not know of eachothers existance because your encrypted handles will be different.

Keep your ciphers private and only share, preferably in person not over email, with the person you wish to speak with.
