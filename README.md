Anonymous Communication App
=======================

####Instant Messaging

To maintain the most secure and anonymous communication, both you and the person you are 
IMing must know eachothers handles, and must use the same cipher. 
*Both handles and ciphers are case sensitive!*
All communications are automatically encrypted and decrypted for you using the cipher and a salt.

Handles are encrypted using the cipher, salt and other persons handle  so anyone can use any handle, given your cipher and partner are unique, even if someone else chooses to use the same handle it is __HIGHLY__ unlikely both your partner name and cipher will also be the same.

Keep your ciphers private and only share, preferably in person not over email, with the person you wish to speak with.
