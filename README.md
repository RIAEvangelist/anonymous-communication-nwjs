Anonymous Communication App
=======================
***Government level encryption/decryption (U.S. FIPS). The same encryption is used by NSA and other governments around the world to secure classified data.***

####Instant Messaging

To maintain the most secure and anonymous communication, both you and the person you are 
IMing must know eachothers handles, and must use the same cipher. 
*Both handles and ciphers are case sensitive!*
All communications are automatically encrypted and decrypted for you using the cipher.

Handles are not password protected so anyone can use any handle, but the only 
way to see the data is to have the correct cipher.
